Dear WW, 
Thank you for your consideration, I tried to not really state the company name, since my Github is public. 

I had one issue with question 2, the state page titles were not exactly the same as the current site, so I changed them accordingly to match.

Again, thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon.
